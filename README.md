# Rancid Tomatillos

## Description
Rancid Tomatillos is a movie information app that allows users to explore popular movies, view detailed information about each movie, and vote for their favorites. The app includes features such as:
- A homepage displaying movie posters and titles.
- A detailed view of each movie, showing genres, an overview, and more.
- A functional search bar for live filtering of movies by title.
- Voting functionality for users to upvote or downvote movies.

The app is built using React and leverages React Router for navigation. It consumes data from a backend API to fetch movie details and updates.
The work on the project was completed over the course of 8 days.

- **React Router**: Implemented for seamless navigation between pages, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- **API Integration**: Data is fetched from a backend API, enabling real-time updates and a responsive voting system.
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing with Cypress ensures the app functions correctly and meets user stories.
